---

I had been going back and forth on trying to build my own [6-DOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_freedom) robotic arm. Have a couple of [MG995](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQJ1VZ2) lying out from a few other projects. I even designed an arm and was looking to put it together. 

The initial idea was to get a RPi Pico to control the arm, and have it controlled via a computer. But then a couple of weeks ago, I hit upon this video in my feed, and it's fascinating. Looking to invest in the hardware to see if I can put one together and see how that works!
