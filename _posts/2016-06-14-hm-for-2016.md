All the half marathons [HM] listed below are fairly flat and on an easy terrain. An average HM plan recommends a 12-16 week plan depending upon your fitness level & goals. You can try to get away with zero running and still complete one with a 12 week plan. If you are looking for a target race time, be ready for more commitment.

### Word of Advice

* Some words of wisdom, I've learnt along the way of injuries, DNF (Did not Finish) & races
* Motivation only works for the first week or two, beyond that you need discipline. 
  * [Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X)
* Set a fixed time and day of the week for a run, and try to run at the same time during the week. I would recommend morning, so you have no  unexpected changes during the day which can deviate you from your plan. 
  * [Eat That Frog](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-That-Frog-Great-Procrastinating/dp/1576754227)
* Being a weekend warrior is only going to increase your chance of an injury, and push you behind in your schedule. 
* If your run asks for an hour of commitment, but you have only 1/2, do the half! Anything greater than 0 is good. A small run if better than no run. 
* If you miss a day, it is okay, skip it and move on. 
* If you miss a week, it is kind of okay, lose some fitness and move on. 
* If you miss more than 2 weeks, you need to reevaluate your commitments. 
* Don't worry if your weight increases a first few weeks of training, it is normal. 
* BUT you cannot just hog more food, just cos you are running. Don't add more than 200-300 calories to your diet on days you run. Junk food/Alcohol will not magically evaporate with running. 
* You cannot wring out on race day. 
* You can fool a 5K, not a 20K. 

### Pace 
Running "speed" is measured in terms of pace, minutes per mile (min/mile)

####  What is pace ?

[Pace for running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_(speed)#Running) is the time (or average time) taken to complete a mile/kilometer. So if you take 10 minutes to complete a mile you are running at a pace of 10:00 min/mile. Pace is easier to comprehend as compared to speed (my personal opinion) when running. [Cool Running](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/4/4_1/96.shtml) is the oldest site which helps with pace calculators.

If you do not know your pace yet (new runner) then try to run at least a 5K to get an idea what your average pace is. A mile is too short, as you might push yourself into a sprint. Sprinting is when you run at your full potential, the speed you run at when a dog chases you.

For distance running your pace should be fast enough to call it a run, but also easy enough to hold a conversation with someone. If you cannot talk while running, feel out of breath, you are running too fast! Slow down! You pace has to be kind of consistent (5-10% variation is okay) throughout the whole run.
