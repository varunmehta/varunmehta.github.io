Own your network, Own your client. What do we mean by that ?

When building a SaaS based service, companies built strong systems for their clients to use. All the latest web 2.0 features and implement the security best practices, but many of them fail to make basic statistics available to them.

I've tried to list a few of the short-comings companies should look at resolving;

### Usage Statistics
If you bill the client per transaction and the amount of load they use on the system, its always nice to have this information available at the customer information screen of the application.

### Billing Information 
Invoices and bills should be readily available in the system. Build a billing engine right into the application, saves the finance team a lot of effort processing invoices on a monthly basis and then following up with the clients.

### Auto-payments 
You don't want to be left in the limbo, with the client not paying on time and keeping you stranded without money for months. In this age of advanced e-commerce and online banking, its advisable to go the extra mile and integrate an auto-pay system into your application.
