description: SSH into Jailbroken iPhone
---

It's been some time the iPhone jailbreak is available, and there are many posts available online. But I wanted to boast about my jailbroken version. Here are a few screenshots.

First the unix version; 
``` 
uname -a 
``` 

After that I wanted to use some standard unix commands, but they were not available. When using Cydia, I saw some `apt-get` being executed; so tried it and installed `top`

I started MobileSafari to check if was realtime, or it popped up in ms on this screen.

I was bored over the weekend and decided to jailbreak it, and was wondering; "What kept me away from it!!"
