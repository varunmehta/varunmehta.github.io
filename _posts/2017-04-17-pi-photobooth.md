So as part of the [Raspberry Jam](/makers-day) show &amp; tell item, I've decided to go ahead and make a photo booth. I'm not the first one using the pi camera and python to create one, but never the less, it is a fun learning experience.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" data-footer="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/varunmehta/albums/72157679713572213" title="RPi Photo Booth"><img alt="RPi Photo Booth" height="768" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2840/33805724060_6e2bfbaa1a_b.jpg" width="1024" /></a><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js"></script>
