description: Migrating all blogs and consolidating them under one group.
---

Over the years, I've written blogs across different service providers (blogger, wordpress, github, medium, substack), depending upon which was a good running service at that time. I was tempted to try LinkedIn, but then decided to go back to github, and use a free instance with no frills.

 My articles are now fragmented across different providers. I've started consolidating them to this blog. You'll sporadically see some of the older articles show up based on how soon I'm able to find the article and move it over to the new format.

Along the way I was also able to procure some of my old website designs from 1999 and early 2000s. I'll try to get them working under the current stack and see if they are able to run for the current internet. The biggest challenge is getting the flash player working on it.
