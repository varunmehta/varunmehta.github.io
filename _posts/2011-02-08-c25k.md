description: Couch to 5K
---

Now that Tanvi is here, I need to get fitter so I can play and run with her!!

C25K: Couch to 5 kilometers (3.1 miles). Finally finished my c25K training and was finally able to run a 5K (not a race, just by itself!), and it was awesome.

C25K is the perfect program for someone who has never run and wants to start running. Just 30 minutes a day, 3 times a week, and after 9 weeks you can run 5 kilometers! It is awesome. The idea was first publicized by coolrunning.com.

Check their [program](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml).

With the app industry bustling with, there is an app for everything, you can search your phone's store to get an app. I used "Ease into 5K" to get me started, repeated week 4 multiple times to get comfortable with the pace and distance. An effort worth spending.
