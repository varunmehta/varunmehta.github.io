**Contact** is a hard science fiction novel by Carl Sagan, exploring topics around [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence), and contact between humanity and an advanced extraterrestrial life form. The book indirectly address [Fermi's Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc), though not calling it out explicitly. The book is old enough where you see traces of cold-war era tensions between the USA and USSR (Soviet Union).

In real life, Carl Sagan was part of the team that worked on the [Voyager Golden Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record) there by engaging in METI (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence). There are interesting controversies and concerns around potential impact of alien contact. Stephen Hawking warns against transmitting our location to other more advanced civilizations, causing potential extermination of the earth. The idea is based off humankind's own history of treating it's own kind harshly.

As I was reading the book, an old episode of Radiolab [The Nothing Behind Everything](https://radiolab.org/podcast/the-nothing-behind-everything) resurfaced
