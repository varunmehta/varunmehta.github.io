Ever see those annoying ads on websites you are visiting, which advertise services or locations around where you are currently surfing. How do they figure out where you are??

Such kind of targeting in the online media world is called as "geo-targeting". Every computer or device that connects to the internet gets an IP address assigned to it. These addresses are assigned based on your location, so if you are in North America your IP will start from `63.*.*.*` or `64.*.*.*`. If you are in Asia, your IP address will range in `202.*.*.*` or `212.*.*.*`, so on and so forth. These addresses are further drilled to second and third level based on the subnet mask.
