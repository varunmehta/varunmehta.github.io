description: Ran my first Half-Marathon
---
After finishing the 5K, I got ambitious and decided to scale longer distances. Inched myself from 5K to an 8K and then a 10K. It was awesome to see the progress. After a long lull of running on the treadmill, I ventured out to run on the roads. It was miserable at first as you have no clue about your pace or the distance you travelled. The body is used to running, has not internalized a pace for you.

I download Runkeeper Free to track my runs. It is a nice little GPS enabled app with alerts about pace and time and distance.

One fine Friday morning, I decided to go out for a run, and saw banners all over Newport, Jersey City about [Newport Liberty Half Marathon](http://www.newporthalfmarathon.com/). If I can run 6 miles, I can run 13.1.

My first ever 6+ miles run on Friday.

That weekend on Sunday, ran my first half marathon. My finish time was 3:19:03.07, and was placed 2215/2225 of the whole set. Average pace 15:00 min/mile. I completed and loved the experience.

Was dehydrated, famished, chaffed, blistered, out paced, by a 69 year old runner (who finished 14 minutes after me). I was at mile 10 at the 2 hour mark, and was just walking my way to the finish line. Got some gatorade at mile 11, and finally made it!. 

Sitting sore after a week. Will run tomorrow.
