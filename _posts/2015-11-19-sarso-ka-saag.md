Over the past decade of cooking, I've collected a few recipies. I'm going to start documenting them here! 

Saag is a mixture of two basic green leaves, Spinach & Brocolli Rabe. Brocolli Rabe can get bitter to eat. Modifying ratios of Spinach to Brocolli Rabe can help ease the bitterness. The ideal ratio is 2:1 (2 bunches of Spinach and 1 of Brocolli Rabe)

## Ingredients 
- 2 bunches of spinach
- 2 bunch of brocolli rabe
- 1/2 cup chana daal
- 2-3 green chilies 
- 4-5 turnip 
- 1 Onion finely chopped
- 2 tablespoon of ginger paste (or very finely chopped)
- 2 tablespoon of garlic paste (or very finely chopped)
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds 
- 1 teaspoon of garam masala 
- 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)
- Cottage cheese (big curd) full fat
- Salt to taste

## Directions 
- Clean fresh green leaves nicely double strain. (Avoid using baby spinach)
- Put the green chilies, turnips, brocolli rabe and spinach into an instant pot (no need to add water). 
- Cook for 10 minutes. Natural Release 
- Remove the mixture and blend it 5-7 seconds. 
  - You are not trying to make a smoothie, just break up the big pieces.

### Tadka (Tempering)
- In a small pan, heat 2 tablespoon of ghee
- Add cumin seeds and sauté till it's a little darker
- Add onions and sauté, till pink
- Add ginger & garlic paste, sauté
- Add garam masala, turmeric
- Add the blended saag, and salt to taste
- Stir on slow flame for 8-10 minutes.
- Add kasuri methi and stir nicely.
- Add cottage cheese and mix (this should reduces the bitterness)
