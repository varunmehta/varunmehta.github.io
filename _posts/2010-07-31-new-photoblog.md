I moved out of my [old photography blog](http://varunphotography.blogspot.com/) and started a [new one](http://varunmehtaphotography.blogspot.com/)!

My Sony DSC-S60 was getting old, and I have laid my hands on a fresh new DSLR, Canon 50D. Picked up the default 28-135mm/3.5-5.6f lens with a 50mm/1.8f.

Starting this dedicated blog to keep this more personal and technical, and that exclusively about photography. Hope to checkout some awesome posts out there!

The photographs will be hosted on flickr and then embedded on the pages. I don't trust blogger to do justice with the pics.
