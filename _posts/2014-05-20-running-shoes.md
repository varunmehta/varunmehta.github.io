Your shoes run an average of 350-500 miles. I replace them at 400-450. After that they are good for lawn work.

Strava, Garmin Connect have shoe tracking. So you can track your shoe's mileage. This is very useful and important to prevent injuries. The mid-sole of the shoe, also the shock absorbing layer get damaged over the period of time, and reduces shock absorption. I had measured my shoe's thickness when brand new and after 400 miles. The thickness was reduced by 3mm due to compression.

If you know your size and that the type (stability or neutral) of shoe, then check [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/), [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/), [holabirdsports.com](http://holabirdsports.com/), [jackrabbit](https://www.jackrabbit.com/) (NYC store, online too). Try picking up the previous year's model, as they generally run $20-50 cheaper.

Here is a list of shoe stores, runners have collected over the years. The list was created by [redditors on runnit](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/faq#wiki_what_shoes_do_i_buy.3F).

If training for a full or half, always keep 2 pairs of shoes and rotate them weekly or for alternate runs. Do all types of  runs in both the pairs, so if one is damaged or wet, you can use the other. Also one might be more comfortable than the other, just a personal preference. Brooks, Asics, Saucony are some of the brands I've tried and love. Find a shoe which fits you best.

If you don't know your shoe type. Go to the nearest shoe store in your town and they can help you get assessed. Most of them will price match amazon or other shoe store for the newer models.

If you go to Road Runners, don't fall for the insoles trap! Else they are an awesome shoe store. My favorite store in the New York area is JackRabbit sports.
