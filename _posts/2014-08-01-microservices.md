Over the past couple of months, I've been reading a lot about microservices, continuous integration and continuous delivery, multiple deployments in a day. Finally had the opportunity to visit the talk by Adrian Cockroft on microservices at QCon 2014. This has been one of the most detailed an eye opening conversation around microservices. I would recommend everyone to visit the site and know more about it.

The team here at Operative is buzzing about moving the existing monolith to microservices, and this is a good trigger!
