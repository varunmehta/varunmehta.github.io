After running the [Newport Liberty Half Marathon](http://www.newporthalfmarathon.com/) for the 5th time and achieving my PR 2:10:07 (was targeting sub 2 hour) and helping setup a plan with my running troupe, I've decided to help a bigger bunch this year. Started a Whatsapp group with a few friends who I know are interested to run.

The target race is [NJ Marathon](http://www.thenewjerseymarathon.com/), and the race plan is [Hal Higdon Novice 2](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51312/Half-Marathon-Novice-2-Training-Program).

Here is the link to the [iCloud calendar](webcal://p01-calendars.icloud.com/published/2/fu-t5G7dbn4SZSMVR37o2GbYQgDQ7b6wJBdqP3tIorzT4OMKqF1DiJf9on6oETcBaNbPY9QaUQl0j82-i0ZEP-5x-LVQ5EEGoA3qDuSzkfo)

Feel free to download, import the ics and join the schedule!

The only benefit of the Whatsapp group is I spew some running experience based general knowledge and ideas to help the group train better.

See you guys at the shore 2016!
