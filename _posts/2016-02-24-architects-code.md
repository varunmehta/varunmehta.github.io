description: Why Should Software Architects Write Code?
---
I'm of the opinion, architects should write code. They might not be able to deliver day-in/day-out feature related code, but always being hands on is something you should never give up. 

Interesting article to read, rather than try to summarize or hijack the article, please read it in original.
