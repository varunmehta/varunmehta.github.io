## For the chicken marinade:
- 1 pound chicken with bone cut into medium pieces
- 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
- 2 tablespoons red chilli powder, divided
- 1/2 tablespoon turmeric powder
- Salt

## For the spice paste:
- 2 tablespoons fresh grated coconut
- 1 cup water
- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds
- 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
- 6 dry Kashmiri chillis
- 5 peppercorns
- 1/2 inch stick cinnamon
- 3 cloves

## For the curry:
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 3 slit green chillies
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 medium onion chopped fine

## Directions

### Marinate:
- Mix the ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the red chili powder. 
- Apply on chicken and set aside while you prepare the spice paste and curry. 
Spice Paste:
- For the spice paste, heat the cast iron skillet until it's smoking. 
- Turn the heat down. Except for the coconut and water, toast all the ingredients until they release their aroma, about 15 seconds, stirring constantly so they don't burn. 
- Set aside to cool. Once cool, blend with the coconut and 3 tablespoons water till it forms a smooth paste. 
- Set aside.

### Curry: 
- Heat oil until it's shimmering in the heavy-bottomed (and lidded) saucepan. 
- Turn heat down.
- Add green chillies and bay leaves. Stir until fragrant, about 15 seconds. 
- Add the onions and keep stirring until soft but not brown, about 5 minutes. 
- Add the spice paste and keep stirring until fragrant and until oil floats on top, about ten minutes. 
- Add the marinated chicken pieces, stir until they are coated in the spice mix, about 5 minutes. 
- Add the remaining water to thin out the mixture for more gravy. 
- Season with salt, stir once and close the lid. 
- Turn the heat to medium. 
- Cook for about 15 minutes, until chicken is tender.
-  Open lid, stir and serve hot with fluffy white rice.
