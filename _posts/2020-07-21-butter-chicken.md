- Small piece of ginger 
- 5-8 cloves of garlic 
- 2-3 whole small green chillies 
- Handful stem of cilantro.

### Chicken Marinade
- 1 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder (Cayenne Pepper powder will also do as far as you know your limit)

- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 lime squeezed
- 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste (50% each)
- 1/2 cup greek yogurt
- 1-2 teaspoon kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves) ~ This is what gives the butter chicken it's distinct aroma
- 1-2 teaspoon garam masala. 


## Directions

### Step 1: Prepare Marinade & Marinate Chicken
(boneless chicken thighs taste wayyyy better than chicken breast )
- Squeeze a lemon in a bowl
- Add red chilli powder,  turmeric, salt, ginger-garlic paste and mix well. 
- Make small cuts on the chicken thighs and marinade with this mix. 
- Set timer for 15 minutes

### Step 2: Prepare second Marinade 
- Mix yogurt & garam masala
- After 15 minutes have passed, mix with the existing marinated chicken and leave it for another 30 minutes to overnight (as long as you like it)

### Step 3: Make the Curry
- In a sauce-pan, add water
- Add onions and tomatoes cut to bite size pieces (1" approx)
- Slash the green chillies vertically, just cutting one side, so it reveals the seeds. 
- Add all spices into to pot
- Cover with lid and let simmer on medium for 15-20 minutes
- Add 1 teaspoon of salt.
- Stir occasionally to ensure the onions don't brown and there is still water in the  pan.
- Once the tomatoes are soft and the green chillies can be squished, it is ready to get off the stove.
- Take a chopstick or fork, and carefully remove the following spices from the pan.
  - 3-4 cloves
  - 1 stick of cinnamon
  - 4-7 balls of black pepper
  - 1 piece of mace
  - 2-3 bay leaves
