# Hi, I'm Varun 👋

I currently serve as a CoFounder of my [small startup](https://braineatingmachines.com), where I build robotics focused simulation environments for robot training. Across my career I have led engineering teams at Slalom, built niche products for Fortune 500 companies and executed large modernization and cloud migrations initiatives.

        <p>I started my engineering journey <a href="https://varunmehta.github.io/1999-2003" target="_blank">back in the 90s</a>. Spent my early days designing <a href="https://varunmehta.github.io/restore-archive-1999-2003/">websites</a>, and writing code in C & Pascal, eventually settling with Java for enterprise applications. Currently I dabble with Python for data pipelines, robotics, AI and machine learning.</p>

		<p>
		Constantly solving interesting problems presented by clients, challenging situations, or personal exploration in pursuit of better solutions. When I discover any, I try to <a href="/blog">share these insights</a> and see them implemented by others to create real-world impact.

## What are some interesting projects you are working on? 
I try to keep [projects](/projects) up to date as much as possible. Some of my [3D printing models](https://www.printables.com/@emortal_2112934) are also available for free printing.

## What do I do for fun
I like to run, bike, swim, hike when possible. To de-stress, I cook, also allows me to keep track of what I'm eating.  Off late I've started the [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/) program and have seen some improvements when climbing hills.
