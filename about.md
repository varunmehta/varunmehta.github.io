# Hi, I'm Varun ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Varun Mehta. I am the Director of Software Engineer, currently working at Slalom, where I help clients build new products, AI-powered experiences, and execute large modernization and cloud migrations initiatives.

I started my engineering journey [back in the 90s](link_to_old_portfolio). Spent my early days designing [websites](old_portfolio), and writing code in C & Pascal, eventually settling with Java for enterprise applications. Currently I dabble with Python for data pipelines, robotics, AI and machine learning.

## What are some interesting projects you are working on? 
I try to keep [projects](/projects) up to date as much as possible. Some of my [3D printing models](https://www.printables.com/@emortal_2112934) are also available for free printing.

## What do I do for fun
I like to run, bike, swim, hike when possible. To de-stress, I cook, also allows me to keep track of what I'm eating.  Off late I've started the [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/) program and have seen some improvements when attacking hills on the bike.
