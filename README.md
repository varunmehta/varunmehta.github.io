# Welcome to varunmehta.github.io

This was a fun experiment migrating everything from my older blogs spread all over the internet across different service providers to one common place at github. 

## TODO
* [ ] Migrate data for 2020-2025
* [ ] Migrate older sites from tripod.com


## Tech Notes

Use this docker command to test locally
```
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve
```
